        Interested in how PETs can make us more self-sovereign individuals & hard engineering problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://arcium.com" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Arcium</a>,
        a confidential computing network to enable generalized trustless & private computations using MPC and ZK.

        Before that, I was on the founding team of <a href="https://tum-boring.com/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>TUM Boring</a> 
        where we built the fastest Tunnel Boring Machine in the world and won the first 
        <a href="https://boringcompany.com/competition" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Not-a-Boring-Competition</a>
        from Elon Musk's Boring Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to that, I worked on using TEEs inside smart phones to more securely manage key material:
        <a href="https://x.com/rivetzcorp?lang=en" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Rivetz</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich, where I was involved with
        <a href="https://www.tum-blockchain.com/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>TUM Blockchain Club</a>,
        <a href="https://www.startmunich.de/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Start Munich</a>,
        and built the (at-the-time) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349111219_Efficient_FPGA_Implementation_of_Blockchain_Operations" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer> fastest FPGA implementation of the Bitcoin Mining Algorithm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, I've previously worked on banking software at
        <a href="https://outbankapp.com/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Outbank</a>, on high-performance networking 
        for Computer Vision at <a href="https://www.nakamir.com/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>Nakamir</a> and moonlighted as 
        a briefly moonlighted as a physicist at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>SLAC</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the above, I enjoy bouldering, foosball, contributing to OSS I use, and alternating between reading about new cryptographic techniques 
        and comic books.
